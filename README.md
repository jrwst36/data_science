## Data Science
Each folder in this repository contains a data science project. Within the folders are evaluated Jupyter Notebooks, however, the data sets are not present.

[Home Credit Default Risk](https://github.com/jrwst36/data_science/tree/master/Home_Credit_Default_Risk) is a competition hosted by Kaggle. The object is to determine who will default on their housing loan. In addition to the primary data, there are a variety of supplemental data sets. To classify the test data I use XGBoost. 

[Housing Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://github.com/jrwst36/data_science/tree/master/House_Prices)  is a competition hosted by Kaggle to predict the price of homes in Ames Iowa. I use a linear support vector regressor to predict the housing prices. 

[Pover-T Tests: Predicting Poverty](https://github.com/jrwst36/data_science/tree/master/Pover-T_test) is a competition hosted by DrivenData to classify which households are poor. The data comes from three different countries, and the information collected from each country is unique. I.e. there are no overlapping features between the three countries. I use a random forest classifier to make the predictions.

[Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table ](https://github.com/jrwst36/data_science/tree/master/Pump_it_Up) is a competition hosted by DrivenData to classify the status of water wells in  Tanzanian as functional, functional but needs repair, or not functional. This competition is still underway, so my model is not yet posted but you can find my initial exploratory data analysis there.
