## Data Science
Each folder in this repository contains a data science project. Within the folders are evaluated jupyter notebooks, however, the data sets are not present.

[Home Credit Default Risk](https://github.com/jrwst36/data_science/tree/master/Home_Credit_Default_Risk) is a competition hosted by Kaggle. The object is to determine who will default on their housing loan. In addition to the primary data, there are a variety of supplemental data sets. To classify the test data I use XGBoost. 

[Housing Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://github.com/jrwst36/data_science/tree/master/House_Prices)  is a competition hosted by Kaggle to predict the price of homes in Ames Iowa. I use a linear support vector regressor to predict the housing prices.
